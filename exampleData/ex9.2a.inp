TITLE:	this is an example of a two-level 
	regression analysis for a continuous 
	dependent variable with a random slope 
    and an observed covariate
DATA:	FILE = ex9.2a.dat;
VARIABLE:	NAMES = y x w xm clus;
	WITHIN = x;
	BETWEEN = w xm;
	CLUSTER = clus;
DEFINE:	CENTER x (GROUPMEAN);
ANALYSIS:	TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
ESTIMATOR = BAYES;

MODEL:
	%WITHIN%	
	s | y ON x;
	%BETWEEN%	
	y s ON w xm;
	y WITH s;

OUTPUT: CINTERVAL;
